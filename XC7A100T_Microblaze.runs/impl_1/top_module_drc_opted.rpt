2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PLIO-6#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Invalid constraint on register microblaze/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO0_I_REG. It has the property IOB=TRUE, but it is not driving or driven by any IO element.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-6#2 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Invalid constraint on register microblaze/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_1/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO0_I_REG. It has the property IOB=TRUE, but it is not driving or driven by any IO element.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#1 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell microblaze/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO0_I_REG has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#2 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell microblaze/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/QSPI_LEGACY_MD_GEN.QSPI_CORE_INTERFACE_I/LOGIC_FOR_MD_0_GEN.SPI_MODULE_I/RATIO_NOT_EQUAL_4_GENERATE.SCK_O_NQ_4_NO_STARTUP_USED.SCK_O_NE_4_FDRE_INST has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#3 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell microblaze/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_1/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO0_I_REG has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal microblaze/microblaze_i/mig_7series_0/u_microblaze_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the microblaze/microblaze_i/mig_7series_0/u_microblaze_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of microblaze/microblaze_i/mig_7series_0/u_microblaze_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.

REQP-165#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (microblaze/microblaze_i/axi_dma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_MM2S_FULL.I_MM2S_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_MM2S_SF.I_RD_SF/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg_1) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
